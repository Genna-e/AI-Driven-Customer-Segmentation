# Project Overview
Customer segmentation is a crucial strategy in marketing that involves dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing, such as age, gender, interests, spending habits, etc. This project implements AI-driven customer segmentation using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model and machine learning clustering algorithms to group customers into segments. The segmented data can then be used to create personalized marketing campaigns.

# Objectives
Automate the process of customer segmentation using data from an e-commerce platform.
Develop a pipeline that processes raw data, creates RFM features, and segments customers.
Integrate the segmentation model with marketing tools to automate targeted marketing campaigns.
Visualize the segmentation results and provide actionable insights for marketing strategies.

# Technical Stack
The project utilizes the following technologies and tools:

Python: Core language for data processing and machine learning.
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and clustering models.
Jupyter Notebook: Data exploration and model development.
Flask/Django: API development for integrating with marketing tools.
PostgreSQL/MySQL: Database management for storing customer data.
Tableau/Power BI: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
GitHub Actions: CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/AI-Driven-Customer-Segmentation.git
cd AI-Driven-Customer-Segmentation
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Configure Database (Optional)
If you're using a database like PostgreSQL or MySQL, configure it:

Create a .env file with your database credentials.
Update the database configuration in the project settings.
Data Pipeline
The data pipeline processes raw customer data to generate the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features, which are then used for customer segmentation.

Steps:
Data Ingestion: Load raw data from CSV files or databases.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions.
Feature Engineering: Calculate RFM features based on transaction history.
Data Storage: Save the processed data to a database or CSV files for further analysis.
Model Development
The model development process involves clustering customers based on their RFM values.

Steps:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze and visualize the data to understand customer behavior.
Clustering Model: Use K-Means or another clustering algorithm to segment customers.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the clusters using metrics like silhouette score.
Model Integration: Integrate the model with marketing tools for automated campaign management.
Usage
1. Run the Data Pipeline
Execute the data pipeline to process raw data and generate RFM features:

bash
Copy code
python src/data_pipeline.py
2. Train the Clustering Model
Train the customer segmentation model:

bash
Copy code
python src/train_model.py
3. Launch the API
If you’ve implemented an API for integration, launch it using Flask or Django:

bash
Copy code
flask run  # For Flask
python manage.py runserver  # For Django
4. Visualize the Results
Use Jupyter Notebooks or Tableau/Power BI to visualize the segmentation results and analyze customer segments.
